Hi it's me Nabeel. I figured that since we are all quarantined it would a good time to start a website[^1]. 

I am currently a software engineer in LA working at Foursquare ([used to be Factual](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/foursquare-merges-with-factual/)) mostly on geospatial data. 

### Places I have Worked
* [Acorns](https://www.acorns.com/)  
* [Factual](https://www.factual.com/) -> [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/)

### Books I like (will maybe write some reviews on my favorites)
* [Winners Take All](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37506348-winners-take-all)  
* [The Other Americans](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34851317-the-other-americans)  
* [All the President’s Men](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96123.All_the_President_s_Men)
* [The Meritocracy Trap](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43671669-the-meritocracy-trap)  
* [The American Spy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40274582-american-spy)  
* [The Library Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39507318-the-library-book)  

### Hobbies + Interests
* Basketball (seriously anything involving basketball I’m probably in)
* The outdoors
* Skiing
* Dodgers baseball
* Libraries
* Politics
